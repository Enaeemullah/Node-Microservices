# Node Microservices
NodeJS Microservice Architecture Example with the real-time project.

This is a practical source code of the NodeJS Microservice tutorial serise. Where I have split up a monolithic application into Microservices Architecture. The main goal of this repository is to provide an overview how the microservices architecture is working with nodejs and what is the complexity we need to resolve to achieve the outcome from an Monolithic architecture.
